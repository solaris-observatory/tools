# Solaris Tools

A collection of scripts developed within the **Solaris project**.

These tools support various tasks, such as:

- Calculating pointing errors in Az/El or RA/Dec
- Simulating solar scans and scan accuracy
- Converting and comparing sky coordinates
- Planning and evaluating scan geometry
- General utilities for data analysis and telescope operations

Each script is self-contained and focused on a specific aspect of the
observation pipeline.
